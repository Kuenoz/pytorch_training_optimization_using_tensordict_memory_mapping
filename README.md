data = torch.randn(1000, 1000, dtype=torch.float32)
mapped_tensor = data.storage().new_shared(data.numel()).view(data.size())

# Create a TensorDict
tensor_dict = TensorDict({"input": mapped_tensor}, batch_size=[1000])

# Use the tensor in your model
# model = YourModel()
# output = model(tensor_dict["input"])
```
